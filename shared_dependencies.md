Shared Dependencies:

1. Python Libraries: All the Python files will share common Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, etc. for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

2. SVG Parser: "data_ingestion.py", "data_analysis.py", "style_generation.py", and "output.py" will share an SVG parser for reading and manipulating SVG files.

3. Machine Learning Model: "machine_learning_model.py" will be used by "style_generation.py" for generating new handwriting styles.

4. Algorithmic Model: "algorithmic_model.py" will be used by "style_generation.py" for generating new handwriting styles.

5. Constants: "constants.py" will be shared across all the Python files for maintaining constant values.

6. Utility Functions: "utils.py" will contain utility functions that will be shared across all the Python files.

7. Data Schemas: The data schemas defined in "data_ingestion.py" and "data_analysis.py" will be used by "style_generation.py" and "output.py".

8. GUI Elements: The GUI elements defined in "gui.py" will be used by "main.py" for user interaction.

9. Test Files: The test files in "tests/" will share the same testing framework, possibly pytest.

10. SVG Characters: The SVG characters in "resources/svg_characters/" will be used by "data_ingestion.py", "data_analysis.py", "style_generation.py", and "output.py".

11. Generated Styles: The generated styles in "resources/generated_styles/" will be used by "output.py" and "gui.py".

12. Test Files: The test files in "resources/test_files/" will be used by all the test files in "tests/".

13. Function Names: Function names will be shared across the Python files for code execution and testing. For example, a function defined in "data_ingestion.py" might be used in "data_analysis.py", "style_generation.py", and its corresponding test file "test_data_ingestion.py".
